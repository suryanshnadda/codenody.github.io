operating system?
a) collection of programs that manages hardware resources
b) system service provider to the application programs
c) link to interface the hardware and application programs


To access the services of operating system, the interface is provided by the
System calls

kernel is the program that constitutes the central core of the operating system
kernel is the first part of operating system to load into memory during booting
kernel remains in the memory during the entire computer session

By operating system, the resource management can be done via
time division multiplexing
space division multiplexing

If a process fails, most operating system write the error information to a ______
log file

The OS X has hybrid kernel

The address of the next instruction to be executed by the current process is provided by the
 Program counter
 
  
wait system call returns the process identifier of a terminated child

A process stack does not contain PID of child process

What is interprocess communication
communication between two process

the ready state of a process?
when process is scheduled to run after some execution

In Unix, fork system call creates the new process

The systems which allows only one process execution at a time, are called
uniprocessing systems

A Process Control Block(PCB) does not contain 
 Bootstrap program
 
The number of processes completed per unit time is known as
Throughput

The state of a process is defined by 
the current activity of the process

The Process Control Block is:
Data Structure

The entry of all the PCBs of the current processes is in
Process Table

The degree of multi-programming is
the number of processes in memory

A single thread of control allows the process to perform:
only one task at a time

The objective of multi-programming is to 
Have some process running at all times
